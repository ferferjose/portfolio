                            <p>The first project I worked on with a team was in collaboration with people from Malaga. I developed all the visible parts of the front end and used Bootstrap because I wanted to learn it.</p>

                            <p>This project was done in pairs and its main purpose was to learn how to use XML. However, I also took the opportunity to practice working with iframes and creating simple cards.</p>

                            <p>When I saw the parallax effect, I loved it. So, the main page has this effect, while the other pages feature a simple and responsive layout.</p>

                            <p>In the summer, my partner and I tried to launch our first venture on Amazon. We searched for a specific niche, and eventually, we chose mirrors. We learned how to use WordPress and researched hosting and SEO to do a good job.</p>
